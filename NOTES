OAuth
- OAuth 1.0 is not fun; pleeaase upgrade to OAuth 2.0.
- No way to access from JS without exposing consumer key/secret.

'sandbox' is not well documented:
- didn't understand how it worked until I did a successful files_put
- was trying to create a folder with my app name, but search/metadata didn't find it.

Why a separate api-content domain?

JSON responses should use Content-Type application/json instead of text/javascript:
- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/the-right-json-content-type

Docs:
- not clear how to escape paths: e.g. encodeURIComponent, escape '/' or other chars?
- only /files_put includes ?param=val in the docs, which confused me.
- /shares vs /media descriptions aren't clear

View a file through API: /shares?
- but that creates a "link" in the UI...

fileops usage is inconsistent, not RESTful:
- e.g. /filesops/delete?root=...&path=
- instead, why not:
Create folder:
    POST /folders/<root>/<path>
Delete:
    DELETE /files/<root>/<path>
Move:
    PUT /files/<root>/<path>/move?to=...
Copy:
    PUT  /files/<root>/<path>/copy?to=...
 or POST /files/<root>/<path>?copy_from=...
- copy_refs:
    Substitute for file path?
    PUT /files/<root>/<copy_ref>/copy?to=...
