OAuth
- OAuth 1.0 is not fun; upgrade to OAuth 2.0.
- No way to access from JS without exposing consumer key/secret.

'sandbox' is not well documented:
- didn't understand how it worked until I did a successful files_put
- tried creating a folder with my app name for testing initially, didn't
realize there was an 'Apps' folder.

Why a separate api-content sub-domain?

JSON responses should use Content-Type application/json instead of text/javascript:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/the-right-json-content-type

Docs:
- not clear how to escape paths: e.g. encodeURIComponent, escape '/' or other chars?
- only /files_put includes ?param=val in the docs, which confused me.
- /shares vs /media descriptions aren't clear
- strange that viewing a file through the API (with /shares ?) creates a "link" in the UI.

fileops usage is inconsistent, not RESTful:
- e.g. /filesops/delete?root=...&path=
- inconsistent with more RESTful /<root>/<path> syntax used by other endpoints
- instead, perhaps:
Create folder:
    POST /folders/<root>/<path>
Delete:
    DELETE /files/<root>/<path>
Move:
    PUT /files/<root>/<path>/move?to=...
Copy:
    PUT  /files/<root>/<path>/copy?to=...
 or POST /files/<root>/<path>?copy_from=...
- copy_refs:
    Substitute for file path?
    PUT /files/<root>/<copy_ref>/copy?to=...
